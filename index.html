                <!--Bio-->
                <p>Hello, my name is Mike Gonzalez. I recently completed the Coding Boot Camp at UCF for Full Stack Web Development.
                    I live in Minneola, which is part of the greater Orlando area.</p>

                <p>I am new to coding, but it is something that I love. There is nothing better than being faced with a challenge
                    and having the know how and creativity to solve it. Before coding I had a career in Sales, which was
                    great, but it wasn't something that I always enjoyed doing. Go ahead and insert your favorite joke about
                    salespeople here, believe me I've heard I'm all.</p>

                <p>When I'm not coding you can find me spending time with family, playing video games, cooking a gourmet meal,
                    or having a nice relaxing day with my 2 dogs George and Rico. I'm also a really big sports fan and you'll
                    often find me at the Orlando City soccer games. Go Lions!</p>

                <p>Thanks For Visiting and Happy Coding!!!</p>
